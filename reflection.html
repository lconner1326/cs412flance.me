    <h1>Reflection on Industry Visit: CMA CGM - Checked</h1>
    <p>
      During our visit to CMA CGM, I gained valuable insights into how their company operates, 
      spanning across four separate presentations. The one I found the most interesting was the second one 
      that talked about their goal of reducing carbon emissions to net zero. This goal is very ambitious in 
      my opinion, but they've built this whole company around it and I think they'll get there. As a member of 
      a sustainability organization back at TAMU, this was definitely the most enjoyable part of the presentations.
      The other cool presentation was the one that went more in depth about their maritime transport, like how they 
      optimize fouling removal, and the graphs he showed that highlighted their endeavors.

      It was also pretty cool to hear a bunch of the new terms we've been learning in this cloud computing course get mentioned
      by these presenters. For example, they used AWS to migrate their servers onto the cloud for improved reliability and scalability, 
      which are ideas we've discussed in class. We've also been using AWS for our class projects, so it's cool to see that a company
      as large as them chooses the same service. They also mentioned a few standards they follow/implememnt, which also corresponds and is 
      essential to the world of cloud computing. Overall, this visit piqued my interest in the company, and while I want a more cybersecurity
      focused carrer, they'll definitely be on my radar.
